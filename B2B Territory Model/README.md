# B2B Territory Model
This project developed a comprehensive territory-based sales coverage plan for B2B telecommunications services, combining market segmentation analysis with automated lead distribution to optimize sales team performance and market penetration.

---

## üìä Objective

To maximize B2B market penetration in the Ontario region by:
- Analyzing territorial coverage and market opportunity sizing
- Implementing data-driven sales territory segmentation 
- Automating lead distribution based on territory assignments and rep capacity
- Supporting go-to-market strategy for new product launches through predictive modeling

The system contributed to measurable growth in B2B penetration rates over a 12-month period.

## üßæ SQL Logic Overview

*Auto Top-Up System*
- Recursive CTEs to identify target campaigns and available capacity
- Dynamic lead allocation based on rep performance metrics (activity ratios, pipeline health)
- Territory matching using postal code assignments
- Capacity constraints preventing overallocation (max 250 total, 30 new, 55% in-progress ratio)

*Campaign Reporting System*
- Multi-channel attribution tracking leads through opportunity lifecycle
- Performance metrics including RPC (Right Party Contact) analysis
- Revenue attribution across wireless/wireline product categories
- Stage duration tracking for opportunity pipeline health
