# About me

A people-first problem solver with a "Swiss army knife" approach to analytics, I bring 7+ years of experience across data, strategy, and cross-functional business domains—including finance, marketing, and sales. I believe meaningful insights come from blending technical depth with business context and clear storytelling. This portfolio highlights how I’ve used data to drive decisions, shape strategy, and deliver impact across a range of real-world challenges.
