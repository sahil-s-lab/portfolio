# About me

A people-first problem solver with a "Swiss army knife" approach to analytics, I blend 7+ years of experience in data, strategy, and cross-functional business domains ‚Äî finance, marketing, and sales. I believe that powerful insights stem not just from technical depth, but from understanding context and telling the right story with data.

This portfolio is a brief window into the kinds of problems I‚Äôve helped solve. From territory optimization to performance dashboards and predictive modeling ‚Äî each project highlights how I've applied data to drive decisions, shape strategy, and deliver impact.
