# About me

A people-first problem solver with a "Swiss army knife" approach to analytics, I blend 7+ years of experience in data, strategy, and cross-functional business domains — finance, marketing, and sales. I believe that powerful insights stem not just from technical depth, but from understanding context and telling the right story with data.

This portfolio is a brief window into the kinds of problems I’ve helped solve. From territory optimization to performance dashboards and predictive modeling — each project highlights how I've applied data to drive decisions, shape strategy, and deliver impact.

Explore the selected projects below.
